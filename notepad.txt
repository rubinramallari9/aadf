Login Implementation
Looking at the code, login functionality is implemented through the LoginView class in the backend (server/aadf/views.py), and it appears all user roles use the same login screen at /login.
However, I don't see specific admin or evaluator accounts pre-created in the code. Looking at the registration implementation, there's a security check that prevents creating admin or evaluator accounts through the standard registration process:
typescript// From RegisterView in server/aadf/views.py
if role != 'vendor' and not request.user.is_authenticated:
    return Response(
        {'error': 'Only vendor registration is allowed without admin approval'},
        status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
    )
    
// If staff/admin registration, check if request is from an admin
if role in ['staff', 'admin'] and (not request.user.is_authenticated or request.user.role != 'admin'):
    return Response(
        {'error': 'Only administrators can create staff or admin accounts'},
        status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
    )
This means:

Anyone can register as a vendor
Only an admin can create other admin, staff, or evaluator accounts

How to Create Admin/Evaluator Accounts
Since you've already created staff and vendor accounts, you have two options to create admin and evaluator accounts:
Option 1: Direct Database Insertion (Development Environment)
Use Django's admin interface or direct database access to create these users with the appropriate roles.
Option 2: Create an Admin First via Django Management Command
You could add a custom Django management command to create an initial admin user. For example:create_admin.py (Django Management Command)CodeÂ # server/aadf/management/commands/create_admin.py

from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from aadf.models import User

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Create an admin user and/or evYou would run this command like:
bash# Create admin user
python manage.py create_admin --username=admin --email=admin@example.com --password=securepassword --role=admin

# Create evaluator user
python manage.py create_admin --username=evaluator1 --email=evaluator@example.com --password=evaluatorpass --role=evaluator
Once you have an admin account, you can then login and create other user accounts through the application interface.
Example User Creation Flow
Here's the typical flow to set up all user roles:

Create admin account using the custom command above
Login as admin at /login
Create evaluator accounts

As admin, navigate to user management
Create users with the "evaluator" role


Create additional staff accounts (if needed)

Create users with the "staff" role


Vendors self-register through the registration page

Accessing Different User Areas
Based on my analysis of the React components:

After login, each user is directed to the Dashboard (/dashboard)
The Dashboard component (in client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx) renders different content based on the user's role
The Sidebar component (in client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx) shows different navigation options based on role

The system appears well-structured with proper role-based access control throughout the application.
